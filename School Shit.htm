        <h3>My school life</h3>
        <p>My life in school has been very tedious and not so forgiving, when my dad heard i entered 
        <a href= file:///C:/Users/abuye/Pictures/FUTO%20STUDENTS%20ONLY%20%2020170805_210847.jpg>FUTO </a> as my school of choice, 
        he was really pissed until he saw my Post UTME result</p>
        </br I smashed the PUTME and he was so happy and proud and actually thought it was one of the best reknowned schools inthe country so why not? 
        <p>I got in and there the battle started. From one class to another, literaly trekking from one end of the school to the next and trust me when I say, it wasn't funny at all.</p>
        
        <p>I wasn't really chirpy or overexcited by the idea of being a FUTO student but I wasn't dreading the idea either....at least not at the time.</p>
