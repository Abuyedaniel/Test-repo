    <!--Who's Buchi-->
    <h2 align="center"> About Buchi</h2>
    <p><a href=file:///C:/Users/abuye/Pictures/Buchi.JPG>She's</a> an amazing creature, fair and beautiful in every way, people say she's short but I just think her height's perfect and cute.</p>
    <hr width=75% color=blue>
    I love everything about her although i can't really tell her cuz i have absolutely no idea how she's gonna take it and besides, she might just punch me in d face or she might just hiss and dats all.
    She looks amazingly cute when lying down and she even thinks I'm weird looking at her, she eats one fufu but always makes me buy two, makes weird demands like a boss lady and always expects me to meet up with them. 
    ooh, did I also mention? she's a perv, a mighty perv, although she's a romantic perv (I mean d kinda perv I like) unlike my perv-ass roomie...lol
    <hr align=right width=75% color=red />
    <p>She's as weird as i am or a bit close, prefers d milk flavoured nibit to the chocolate flavour...i mean, who does that? her best food's rice and stew with fried chicken,
    she loves sprite a lot and i still wonder why.
    <p>She has weird reactions to some situations and it gets me wondering "what can i do to please her or make her happy?" and at the end it seems like i've done it and she's happy but the next minute we're having a word fight.
    nowadays i can't even tell when she's happy or needs my attention. I hope she stops giving me unecessary migrains. I just want us to be able to sort things out by talking about them, I want her to tell me when she's mad (at me or someone else) and how I can help make her feel better.

    <!--Letter from my weird heart-->
    <div class="personal">
    This is referred directly to u babe. I love u and i've tried all i can to let u know this but i don't know if its working cuz sometimes u seem to push me away and it makes me wonder if i did something wrong.
    I'm sorry if i offended u this morning, I didn't really feel like I left u in a gr8 mood and i truly apologize for that and i hope we can converse more whenever something happens.
    I'd love to know how u're doing every minute of everyday and if i can help d situation, i promise to do so with everything i have. If it is possible, i would kiss away d pain whenever u need me to but please, don't push me away. All i want is a chance to handle ur heart and if u think i'm not up to the task u can 
    take it right back and i promise it'll be in one piece.
    </div>
    <p>By now, u should know I give several shits about u and I do think about u alot.</p>
